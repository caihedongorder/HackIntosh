Finally, keep in mind you cannot provide patched SSDTs without dropping the OEM SSDTs that they replace. 
The easiest way is to use DropSSDT=Yes (Chameleon) or ACPI/SSDT/DropOem=true (Clover) to drop all the SSDTs, 
then provide the patched (and unpatched) files for loading by the bootloader.

Note: The SSDTs must be loaded by the bootloader in their original order. 
The original order is specified by the number after the name. 
For example, if you used Clover F4 to extract you might have something like: SSDT-0.aml, SSDT-1.aml, SSDT-2.aml, SSDT-3.aml, which indicates the SSDTs must be loaded in that order (0/1/2/3).



A new feature in the RehabMan fork of Clover allows you to replace OEM SSDTs without using DropOem=true, 
and without using SortedOrder, all the while maintaining original order of the unpatched and patched SSDTs as injected by Clover. 
By setting config.plist/ACPI/AutoMerge=true, this feature is enabled. 
The SSDT must retain its original numbering scheme when placed in ACPI/patched. 
This feature was added as of 2017-10-26 in Clover_v2.4k_r4265.RM-4346.38d5ad43.zip, 
but was not working correctly until 2017-11-24, Clover_v2.4k_r4318.RM-4429.43710d68.pkg. 
The required changes are implemented in the official Clover (on sourceforge) as of r4319. 
Each of the plists linked by the main laptop guide uses AutoMerge=true by default.

Configurations listed first are more desirable.

Full hotpatch:
- all patching is done via config.plist
- only add-on SSDTs in ACPI/patched (eg. no patched DSDT, no patched SSDTs)
- SortedOrder can be left unspecified
- DropOem=false

Partial hotpatch:
- patched DSDT.aml in ACPI/patched
- only add-on SSDTs in ACPI/patched (eg. no patched SSDTs)
- renames (applies to DSDT.aml in ACPI/patched and native SSDTs) done with config.plist
- SortedOrder left unspecified
- DropOem=false

Partial hotpatch with patched SSDTs:
- RehabMan Clover required
- patched DSDT.aml in ACPI/patched
- select patched SSDTs in ACPI/patched (must be named as extracted to ACPI/origin)
- add-on SSDTs also placed in ACPI/patched
- renames can still be done with config.plist
- SortedOrder left unspecified
- config.plist/ACPI/AutoMerge=true
- DropOem=false

Full patched DSDT + SSDTs:
- patched DSDT.aml in ACPI/patched
- full set of static patched OEM SSDTs in ACPI/patched (original names as from ACPI/origin)
- add-on SSDTs also placed in ACPI/patched
- renames in config.plist not recommended (they will apply only to DSDT.aml)
- SortedOrder required to set SSDT load order
- DropOem=true
